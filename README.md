# Portfolio Manager

This tool uses the [SKFolio](https://github.com/skfolio/skfolio) library to optimize a portfolio comprising of various stocks. The data for the stocks is fetched using the [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) library. 

There are two main files in this project: 
1. `src/portfolio_analysis.ipynb`
2. `src/skfolio_analysis.ipynb`

The first file is legacy code kept around for reference (ignore it). The second file is the main piece of code where the optimization takes place. 

**Important Note**: the plots given in `src/skfolio_testing.ipynb` won't show up on the github since they are in HTML format. Run the code locally in order to view the plots.
